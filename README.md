# Read Me

Just a script that imports the logs of my smart power meter, sent to me by my power provider company (E.ON) monthly. I created and scheduled the report on the self service portal of the provider myself. It is sent in XLS, so before importing it with the script, I need to strip the hearder rows, and convert is to CSV manually.
